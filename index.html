    <h2>Hello there!</h2>
    <p>My name is Zachary, and I am an Interactive & Graphic Design major here at Millersville University! I chose to study design because of the problem solving that goes into it each and every day! When I get a prompt for a project or a job for a client, I always feel the rush of excitement that comes with the creative freedom, and I love the ability to take a problem and go through the rigorous journey of solving it, from conceptualization to finished art.</p>
    <p>I especially find an interest in logo design and branding! Finding solutions to the major challenge of brand identity is always satisfying! The mixture of graphic elements and typography is something I find fascinating. I would classify my work as modernist, I always gravitate to the sleek, clean line aesthetic, but I am up to create anything for any occassion!</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite websites consist of Apple, Nike, and Starbucks due to their sleek appearance and ease of use!</p>
